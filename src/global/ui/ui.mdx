<Meta title="UI" />

# UI library

These are the components used cross app, they need to be generic and shouldn't have any business logic.

## Files

All the UI components should live inside `/src/global/ui`

There, you can create a folder with the component name, like Button and, inside of it, you can create files depending of the needs for the component, for example:

`/src/global/ui/Button/Button.tsx` → the main component file

`/src/global/ui/Button/index.ts` → the component that exports everything

`/src/global/ui/Button/Button.style.css` → the main css file

### Storybook

`/src/global/ui/Button/Button.stories.tsx` → the storybook file, you need it in order to show the component in Storybook.

Use autodocs tag to generate an automatic documentation, but also export the proper components variations.

Run npm run storybook to see storybook running at http://localhost:6006/

### Testing

`/src/global/ui/Button/Button.test.tsx` → the test unit file

Run `npm run test:unit:watch` to run unit tests

You can also see coverage reports running `open coverage/index.html`

For the unit tests, we need to make sure we are covering at least all the branches.

## Exporting and Importing

1. You need to export your component WITHOUT using default

2. Add the export for your component in `src/global/ui/index.ts`, like:

```js
export * from "./Button/Button";
```

3. Import in the component you want to use like:

```js
import { Button } from '@global/ui''
```
